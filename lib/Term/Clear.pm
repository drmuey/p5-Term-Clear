=head1 NAME

Term::Clear - `clear` the terminal via a perl function

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Term::Clear version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Term::Clear ();

    Term::Clear::clear();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl function to replace C<system("clear")>.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 clear()

Takes no arguments and clears the terminal screen in as portable way as possible.

Once it does all the work to determine the characters for the system the value is cached in memory so subsequent calls will be faster.

=head2 POSIX

By default it does not try to determine C<OSPEED> from POSIX.

This is because some prefer to avoid loading POSIX for various reasons.

If you want it to try to do that you have two options:

=over 4

=item load POSIX.pm before your first call to C<clear()>.

=item set C<$Term::Clear::POSIX> to true before your first call to C<clear()>.

=item set C<$Term::Clear::POSIX> to true via C<import()>:

    use Term::Clear 'POSIX';
=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Throws no warnings or errors of its own.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Term::Clear requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

It will use L<Term::Cap> and L<POSIX::Termios> if available.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND FEATURES

Please report any bugs or feature requests (and a pull request for bonus points)
